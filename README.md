# Project Title: "CPU Scheduler Simulator"
Description: A GUI-based tool to simulate various CPU scheduling algorithms with visualization and performance metrics.
Installation Instructions:
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/gauravtiwarrii/cpu-scheduler-simulator.git
   cd cpu-scheduler-simulator
3. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Run the application:
   python main.py
Features: List the supported algorithms, GUI capabilities, Gantt chart visualization, animation, comparison, and export functionality.
Usage: adding processes, selecting algorithms, viewing results.
Contributors: Gaurav Tiwari: Algorithms, Kundan kr Ray : GUI, Harshit Kumar Verma : Visualization.

## Features
- Supports FCFS, SJF (Non-Preemptive/Preemptive), Round Robin, Priority (Non-Preemptive/Preemptive), and Intelligent scheduling.
- Interactive GUI for process configuration.
- Gantt chart visualization (static and animated).
- Performance comparison of all algorithms.
- Export results to CSV.

## Usage
1. Add processes with PID, arrival time, burst time, and priority.
2. Select an algorithm and run the simulation.
3. View metrics and Gantt chart.
4. Export results as needed.
